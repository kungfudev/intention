In order for every human being to realise their full potential.
* They need to cultivate a personal vision

In order for a human being to cultivate a personal vision
* They need to reflect on what they have to offer, what they are inspired by, what challenges have they overcome in their life, how they have been helped in their life. http://reinventure.me/014-cultivate-personal-vision/
* They need to identify goals inline with personal vision
* They need to identify key indicators for completion of the goals (how do I know that my goals are being achieved?)
* They need to plan a strategy (how am I going to acheive my goals?)
* They need to identify tasks
* They need to prioritise tasks (what is the most important tasks I need to complete?)
* They need to complete tasks 
* They need to gather feedback (am I on track with realising my vision?)
* They need to need to review their personal vision (with what I have learnt, does my personal vision still hold true?)
* They need to adjust goals if necessary (with what I have learnt, are my goals still realistic, and/or necessary?)
* They need to rework strategy (with what I have learnt, does my strategy still make sense)
